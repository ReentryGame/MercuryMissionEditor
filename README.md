# Mercury Mission Editor
This is the Mission Editor for the Project Mercury program in Reentry.

Important: This is a WPF application, and is a very raw implementation of how a Mission Editor can look. However, the source contains the datastructure needed for the JSON format read by Reentry, so it should be easy to implement editors that could be a web page for example.
